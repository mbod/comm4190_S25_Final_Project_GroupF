## How to run this code:

**DOWNLOAD CODE FOLDER**

**CD INTO FOlDER**

**RUN:** npm install

**RUN:** export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here

(If you want to use mine just to test it out - I emailed my key to the relevant parties - due to the fact that GitHub will scrape and pull the API key if it is on a public account - Feel free to use it, I have hard credit caps on my account)

After the API key is setup then

**RUN:** npm run dev
